def think_tool(reflection: str) -> str:
    """Strategic synthesis and quality assurance tool for investor recommendation workflow.

    Purpose:
    - Performs a single, comprehensive reflection after all data from sub-agents (market, financial, regulatory, execution) is received
    - Enables critical synthesis of multi-domain intelligence before issuing final investment recommendations
    - Assesses data completeness, reliability, and identifies material gaps that could impact investment decisions
    - Ensures high-confidence, evidence-based investor advisory output

    When to Use:
    
    - Creates a deliberate quality checkpoint before final recommendation generation
    - NOT for iterative research planning - this is a thinking step before final execution.

    Strategic Reflection Framework:
    1. **Evidence Synthesis**: Consolidate key findings across market opportunity, competitive positioning, execution capability, and regulatory environment
    2. **Confidence Assessment**: Evaluate the strength and reliability of evidence supporting each major conclusion
    3. **Risk-Reward Clarity**: Assess whether sufficient information exists to quantify investment risks and return potential
    4. **Decision Readiness**: Determine if analysis is complete enough for definitive investment recommendation (INVEST/PASS/CONDITIONAL)

    Args:
        reflection (str): Comprehensive analysis of synthesized findings, evidence quality, critical gaps, and decision on recommendation readiness

    Returns:
        str: Confirmation that strategic reflection has been recorded and incorporated into final advisory process
