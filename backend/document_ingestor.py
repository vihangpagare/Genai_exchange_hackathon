INVESTOR-FOUNDER CALL SESSION
Date: March 20, 2024
Total Duration: 2 hours 15 minutes
Participants: John Founder (CEO), Mike Cofounder (CTO), Sarah Investor (Partner), David Tech (Technical DD)

========== CALL 1: BUSINESS OVERVIEW (45 minutes) ==========
Time: 10:00 AM - 10:45 AM
Participants: John Founder, Sarah Investor

Sarah: John, thanks for making time. Let's start with your current business metrics.

John: Absolutely. We're at $41K MRR as of mid-March, growing about 18% month-over-month. We have 847 active users, with 312 paying customers.

Sarah: What's your unit economics looking like?

John: CAC is averaging $165 across all channels, though it varies significantly. Google Ads runs about $210, but referrals are only $45. LTV is $2,400 based on 24-month average customer lifecycle.

Sarah: That's roughly 14:1 LTV to CAC ratio. How confident are you in those LTV calculations?

John: Pretty confident. We've got 18 months of cohort data now. Our oldest cohorts actually show higher LTV - around $2,800 - so we might be conservative.

Sarah: Tell me about your competitive landscape.

John: There are three main competitors. BigCorp has 60% market share but focuses on enterprise. StartupX raised $50M last year but their product is more complex. LocalPlayer is our closest competitor but they're only in California.

Sarah: How do you differentiate?

John: Speed and simplicity. Our implementation takes 2 hours versus their 2 weeks. Our pricing is transparent - $99/month vs their complex enterprise pricing.

Sarah: What about defensibility?

John: We're building network effects through our marketplace feature. Plus we have proprietary algorithms that took 2 years to develop. Filing patents on our core IP.

Sarah: Walk me through your financial projections.

John: We're targeting $60K MRR by June, $100K by December. Revenue growth should accelerate as we launch enterprise tier and marketplace features.

Sarah: What's your burn rate and runway?

John: Currently burning $52K monthly. We have $850K in the bank, so about 16 months runway. But revenue is growing faster than burn, so effective runway is longer.
